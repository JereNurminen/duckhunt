# duckhunt
A frontend for a webapp where you can store all your important duck sightings, and come back to look back on the fun times you've had spotting ducks.

Pre-assignment for Vincit Summer Job application (2018). The assignment (found [here](http://www.koodarijahti.fi/koodarijahti-tehtavananto.pdf) in Finnish, as of writing this) was to create a frontend for an existing [backend](https://github.com/Vincit/summer-2018/). 

## Technologies used
React. Pretty much just React, Yarn, Webpack et cetera. Mostly because I wanted to solidify my skills with it, and it seemed like the right choice for such a small and dynamic frontend application.
