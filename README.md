# duckhunt
A front-end for a webapp where you can store all your important duck sightings, and come back to look back on the fun times you've had spotting ducks.

Pre-assignment for Vincit Summer Job application (2018). The assignment (found [here](http://www.koodarijahti.fi/koodarijahti-tehtavananto.pdf) in Finnish, as of writing this) was to create a front-end for an existing [back-end](https://github.com/Vincit/summer-2018/). 

## Running the program
Just navigate to its directory, install using `yarn install` and use `yarn start`. This start the development server (You need to have the back-end server running too in order to actually use this).

## Technologies used
* React. Pretty much just React, Yarn, Webpack et cetera. Mostly because I wanted to solidify my skills with it, and it seemed like the right choice for such a small and dynamic application. 

## Retrospective
Although `create-react-app` is handy and easy to use, it adds *a lot* of dependencies, slowing down the build process significantly.
